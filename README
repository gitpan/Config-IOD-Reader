NAME
    Config::IOD::Reader - Read IOD configuration files

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Config::IOD::Reader (from Perl
    distribution Config-IOD-Reader), released on 2014-08-17.

SYNOPSIS
     use Config::IOD::Reader;
     my $reader = Config::IOD::Reader->new(
         # known options
         # allow_directives    => [...],
         # disallow_directives => ['include'],
     );
     my $config_hash = $reader->read_file('config.iod');

DESCRIPTION
    This module reads IOD configuration files. It is a minimalist
    alternative to the more fully-featured Config::IOD. It cannot write IOD
    files and is optimized for low startup overhead.

ATTRIBUTES
  default_section => str (default: "GLOBAL")
    If a key line is specified before any section line, this is the section
    that the key will be put in.

  enable_encoding => bool (default: 1)
    If set to false, then encoding notation will be ignored and key value
    will be parsed as verbatim. Example:

     name = !json null

    With "disable_encoding" in effect, value will not be undef but will be
    string with the value of (as Perl literal) "!json null".

  enable_quoting => bool (default: 1)
    If set to false, then quotes on key value will be ignored and key value
    will be parsed as verbatim. Example:

     name = "line 1\nline2"

    With "disable_quoting" in effect, value will not be a two-line string,
    but will be a one line string with the value of (as Perl literal) "line
    1\\nline2".

  allow_encodings => array
    If defined, set list of allowed encodings. Note that if
    "disallow_encodings" is also set, an encoding must also not be in that
    list.

  disallow_encodings => array
    If defined, set list of disallowed encodings. Note that if
    "allow_encodings" is also set, an encoding must also be in that list.

  allow_directives => array
    If defined, only directives listed here are allowed. Note that if
    "disallow_directives" is also set, a directive must also not be in that
    list.

  disallow_directives => array
    If defined, directives listed here are not allowed. Note that if
    "allow_directives" is also set, a directive must also be in that list.

  allow_bang_only => bool (default: 1)
    Since the mistake of specifying a directive like this:

     !foo

    instead of the correct:

     ;!foo

    is very common, this reader can be configured to allow it.

METHODS
  new(%attrs) => obj
  $reader->read_file($filename) => hash
    Read IOD configuration from a file. Die on errors.

  $reader->read_string($str) => hash
    Read IOD configuration from a string. Die on errors.

TODO
    Add attribute: "allow_dupe_section" (default: 1).

    Add attribute to set behaviour when encountering duplicate key name?
    Default is create array, but we can also croak, replace, ignore.
